  // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
  // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy.

  // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
  // one way

  const captain = person; // NO! it is a copied reference to obj

  // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
